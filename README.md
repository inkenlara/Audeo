## Abstract
We present a novel system that gets as an input, video frames of a musician playing the piano, and generates the music for that video. The generation of music from
visual cues is a challenging problem and it is not clear whether it is an attainable goal at all. Our main aim in this work is to explore the plausibility of such a
transformation and to identify cues and components able to carry the association of sounds with visual events. To achieve the transformation we built a full pipeline
named ‘Audeo’ containing three components. We first translate the video frames of the keyboard and the musician hand movements into raw mechanical musical
symbolic representation Piano-Roll (Roll) for each video frame which represents the keys pressed at each time step. We then adapt the Roll to be amenable for audio
synthesis by including temporal correlations. This step turns out to be critical for meaningful audio generation. In the last step, we implement Midi synthesizers
to generate realistic music. Audeo converts video to audio smoothly and clearly with only a few setup constraints. We evaluate Audeo on piano performance videos
collected from Youtube and obtain that their generated music is of reasonable audio quality and can be successfully recognized with high precision by popular
music identification software.

## Data
We use Youtube Channel videos recorded by [Paul Barton](https://www.youtube.com/user/PaulBartonPiano) to evaluate the Audeo pipeline. For **Pseudo Midi Evaluation**, we use 24 videos of Bach Well-Tempered Clavier Book One (WTC B1). The testing set contains the first 3 Prelude and Fugue performances of Bach Well-Tempered Clavier Book Two (WTC B2) The Youtube Video Id can be found in [here](https://github.com/shlizee/Audeo/blob/master/Video_Id.md). For **Audio Evaluation**, we use 35 videos from WTC B2 (24 Prelude and Fugue pairs and their 11 variants), 8 videos from WTC B1 Variants, and 9 videos from other composers. Since we cannot host the videos due to copyright issues, you need to download the videos yourself.

All videos are set at the frame of 25 fps and the audio sampling rate of 16kHz. The **Pseudo GT Midi** are obtained via [Onsets and Frames framework (OF)](https://github.com/magenta/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/onsets_frames_transcription). We process all videos and keep the full keyboard only and remove all frames that do not contribute to the piano performance (e.g., logos, black screens, etc). The **cropped piano coordinates** can be found in [here](https://github.com/shlizee/Audeo/blob/master/piano_coords.py) (The order is the same as in **Video_Id** file. We trim the initial silent sections up to the first frame in which the first key is being pressed, to align the video, Pseudo GT Midi, and the audio. All silent frames inside each performance are kept.

For your convenience, we provide the following folders/files in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w9wsZM-tPPUVqwdpsefEkrDgkN3kfg7G?usp=sharing):
- **input_images**: examples of how the images data should look like.
- **labels**: training and testing labels of for training/testing Video2Roll Net. Each folder contains a **pkl** file for one video. The labels are dictionaries where **key** is the **frame number** and **value** is a 88 dim vector. See **Video2Roll_dataset.py** for more details.
- **OF_midi_files**: the original Pseudo ground truth midi files obtained from **Onsets and Frames Framework**.
- **midi**: we process the Pseudo GT Midi files to 2D matrix (Piano keys x Time) and down-sampled to 25 fps. Then for each video, we divide them into multiple 2 seconds (50 frames) segments. For example **253-303.npz** includes the 2D matrix from frame 253 to frame 302.
- **estimate_Roll**: the **Roll** predictions obtained from **Video2Roll Net**. Same format as the **midi**. You can directly use them for training **Roll2Midi Net**.
- **Roll2Midi_results**: the **Midi** predictions obtained from **Roll2Midi Net**. Same format as the **midi** and **estimate_Roll**. Ready for **Midy Synth**.
- **Midi_Synth**: synthesized audios from **Roll2Midi_results**.
- **Video2Roll_models**: contains the pre-trained **Video2RollNet.pth**.
- **Roll2Midi_models**: contains the pre-trained **Roll2Midi Net**.
